Given `white` and `black`, representing the initial number of white and black beans, two beans are repeatedly drawn and replaced according to the following rules:

    * Same color → remove both, add one black bean

    * Different colors → remove the black bean, return the white bean

When only one bean remains, return "white" or "black".

**Follow up**: If you are told how many white beans, and how many black beans, are in a can, do you know what colour bean will be left?
